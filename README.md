# aleguy02.dev  
Curious about what I'm up to? This repository contains the source code for the static site being served on [aleguy02.dev](https://aleguy02.dev) with my portfolio site!  

Read the original story README at https://blog.aleguy02.dev/posts/my-first-post/

### How I Deployed  
This site was deployed via a [DigitalOcean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets) running Nginx. A droplet is a Linux-based virtual machine, and Nginx is a web server that lets me serve the content.
Originally, you could only connect to my site by typing the IP address into the search bar, but typing a long IP address every time I wanted to visit the site was a pain! So, I bought the `aleguy02.dev` domain on [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).  I also used some JavaScript to add Cubey (the floating cube), but getting npm and Nginx to work together is hard, so the production site is built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

### The Story
First, I spun up my first DigitalOcean droplet (free with the GitHub Student Developer Pack) by following DigitalOcean‚Äôs tutorial series. I can't recommend these tutorials enough 
if you want to get started‚Äîthey‚Äôre comprehensive, go in order, and are easy to follow. The full series consists of 39 articles (I've made it through about 14 so far), and you can 
find the first one [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/cloud-servers-an-introduction). However, tutorials alone may not answer all your questions, 
so make sure to use a variety of sources‚Äîgo for breadth first. Which brings me to my first big obstacle.  
<br>
After setting up my firewall and installing Nginx, I was ready to configure server blocks. However, to do this, I needed a domain name, so I bought `aleguy02.dev` from Porkbun. 
Great! SSH still worked, so I adjusted some configuration settings to manage my DNS records through DigitalOcean‚Äôs control panel. But upon doing this, I broke something. Suddenly, 
I couldn't SSH into my VM through `aleguy02.dev` anymore, and trying to access the site in Chrome gave me an error. After lots of reading, I discovered my mistake: I had set 
up an A record for `aleguy02.dev` but **not** for `www.aleguy02.dev`. I'm still not 100% sure why that was necessary, but learning is never linear, so I'll come back to it another 
time. Once I fixed that, I could SSH into `aleguy02.dev` again!  
<br>
Eager to see results, I tried Googling my site... "Took too long to connect"? What? Trying to access `aleguy02.dev` in Chrome still gave me an error. I SSHed into my Azure VM 
(which I set up during the previous day's MLH stream) to troubleshoot with `dig` and `ping`. Everything looked fine, so I tested different browsers. Lo and behold, `aleguy02.dev` worked on Firefox!
After more reading and cross-referencing DigitalOcean, Nginx, and Porkbun‚Äôs docs, I found the issue: Chrome (and Arc, the other browser I used for troubleshooting) require an HTTPS (secure) connection 
for any `.dev` domain, which I hadn't set up yet. Enter **Certbot**, and problem solved. Finally, I was able to reach my site :D  
<br>
Let's fast forward a few weeks. I'd redone the site from scratch but manually deploying my site every time I made a little change was a pain (read more [here](https://reidmain.com/2025/01/15/nginx/#:~:text=The%20second%20step%20is%20to,folder%20to%20our%20SSH%20user.)), and I wanted to step up my game.
Enter ü•Åü•Åü•Å **GitHub Actions**! I'd played around with it before but I'd never *really* set up a CD pipeline. I was excited to get started, so I dove in. I explored a lot of different
resources before finding the holy grail: [@appleboy's ssh-action Action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action). It was exactly what I was looking for. If you want to see how I use this Action, 
just check out .github/workflows and read for yourself!. Anyways, the site was live and deployment was automated, but I had another itch to scratch. I wanted to add a little flair to my site and I had just the thing.  
<br>
About a year ago, I made [3UI](https://github.com/aleguy02/3UI), an npm package for... eh whatever if you want the spiel just click the link and read the comments in script/three-ui.js. Long story short, I was using an npm package (three.js) to render a cool 3D cube (I just think it's neat) on the site and needed a way to get this to work OUTSIDE of the VSCode Liver Server extension. I pretty stuck on this for a while, so I opened Perplexity and asked for help. It gave me a good start but honestly overcomplicated the solution a little. HOWEVER, the sources that Perplexity comes up with are nothing short of magnificient. Anyways, I found the answer right in the docs for three.js: Vite! With Vite, I could create a production build, removing npm from the deployment equation altogether.  

-----
This was a big project. Though the final site itself might seem unimpressive to most, the behind-the-scenes process of learning new technologies and getting them to work together was an incredibly gratifying challenge. Big thank you to MLH for their Global Hack Weeks, and a special thank you to [@wei](https://github.com/wei) for our coffee chat a few months ago that put me on this path.
