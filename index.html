        <img src="images/Chromakopia_cover.jpg" />
        <p>
          If you know the story behind this song you'll understand that it's pretty
          emotional. Plus I just like Tyler's production

        <h2>Let It All Work Out</h2>
        <h4>Lil Wayne | Tha Carter V</h3>
        <img src="images/Tha_Carter_cover.jpg" />
        <p>
          I've been listening to this song a loooot. My friend has always preached
          Lil Wayne being great but I only recently started actually listening to
          him.

        <h4>Roger Bart, Disney | Go the Distance</h3>

        <p>
          I don't know why this was #3 on my Spotify On Repeat but hey.
